# MNIST Digit Classification with TensorFlow  

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a benchmark in machine learning and computer vision, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits (0-9).

## Overview  
The primary goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project follows these key steps:  
1. Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.  
2. Designing a CNN architecture to classify the digits.  
3. Training and validating the model.  
4. Evaluating the model on test data and analyzing its performance.  

## Features  
- Data preprocessing: Normalization and reshaping of the MNIST images for model input.  
- A robust CNN architecture that achieves high accuracy.  
- Visualization of training performance (accuracy and loss curves).  
- Performance evaluation with confusion matrices and classification reports.  

## Technologies Used  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the neural network.  
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and model performance.  
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and visualization.  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:  
   - The MNIST dataset is loaded directly from TensorFlow datasets.  
   - Images are normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1 and reshaped for CNN input.  

2. **Model Architecture**:  
   - A CNN with layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, and Dense was implemented.  
   - The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.  

3. **Training and Validation**:  
   - The model was trained on the training dataset with early stopping to prevent overfitting.  
   - Validation accuracy and loss were monitored during training.  

4. **Evaluation**:  
   - Model performance was evaluated using test data, confusion matrix, and classification report.  
   - Accuracy and loss curves were plotted to assess training dynamics.  

5. **Visualization**:  
   - Visual examples of correctly and incorrectly classified digits were plotted for better understanding.  

## Results
**Training Accuracy:** ~99%
**Validation Accuracy:** ~98%
**Test Accuracy:** ~98%
The model demonstrates excellent performance in recognizing handwritten digits, making it a solid baseline for future enhancements.

## Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix is generated to analyze the model's performance across all digit classes, highlighting areas for improvement.

## Future Improvements
Enhance the CNN architecture for even better accuracy.
Experiment with data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
Deploy the trained model as a web application for real-time digit recognition.
